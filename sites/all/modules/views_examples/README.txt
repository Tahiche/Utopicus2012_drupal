How to Use:

1) enable views and views_examples modules

2) go to views_examples admin page: /admin/settings/views_examples

3) check any examples you want to try out (some examples require additional
  modules and those will be noted)

4) go to views build page: /admin/build/views

5) you can edit the example directly, but it's better to clone so you can play
around and not override the original in case you want to easily refer to it later
